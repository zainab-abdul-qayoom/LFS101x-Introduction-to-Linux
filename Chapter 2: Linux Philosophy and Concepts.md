# Chapter 2: Linux Philosophy and Concepts

## Easy Notes

### Linux History

* Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student in Finland.
* In 1992, Linux was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it open source.
* Developers around the world started contributing to Linux and created Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora.
* Today, Linux powers:

  * Most servers on the Internet.
  * Android smartphones.
  * More than 90% of public cloud workloads.
  * The world's fastest supercomputers.

### Linux Philosophy

* Linux is free and open source software.
* Anyone can contribute to its development.
* Linux was inspired by UNIX, but Linux is not UNIX.
* Linux is:

  * Multi-user (many users can use it).
  * Multitasking (many tasks can run at the same time).
  * Secure and stable.
  * Designed for networking and modern computing.

### Linux Community

The Linux community includes:

* Developers
* System administrators
* Students
* Companies
* Open-source contributors

You can learn and get help through:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Linux discussion forums
* Mailing lists
* Linux Foundation courses
* Open-source conferences and events

### Where is Linux Used?

Linux is used in:

* Cloud Computing
* Software Development
* Android devices
* Web Servers
* Search Engines
* Medical Devices
* Weather Forecasting Systems
* Supercomputers
* Cybersecurity
* DevOps

### Linux Distribution

A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel.

A Linux distribution contains:

* Linux Kernel
* Package Manager
* System Libraries
* Desktop Environment
* Applications
* Development Tools

Examples:

* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Fedora
* openSUSE
* Linux Mint
* AlmaLinux
* Rocky Linux

### Important Points

* Linux keeps evolving. New features are added regularly.
* Different Linux distributions may use different kernel versions.
* Most differences between distributions involve package management and system configurations.
* Ubuntu and Fedora are popular among students and developers.
* Ubuntu is widely used in cloud computing.
* Linux documentation is available through man pages.

## Beginner-Friendly Terms

### UNIX

UNIX is an older operating system that inspired Linux.

> Linux is inspired by UNIX, but they are not the same operating system.

---

### Open Source

Open source means the source code is publicly available and anyone can study, improve, or contribute to it.

---

### GPL (General Public License)

A software license that allows users to:

* Use software freely.
* Modify it.
* Share it with others.

---

### Kernel

The kernel is the heart of an operating system.

It manages:

* Memory
* CPU
* Hardware devices
* Running programs

> Think of the kernel as the manager of the entire operating system.

---

### Linux Distribution (Distro)

A complete Linux operating system that includes:

* Kernel
* Package manager
* Applications
* Desktop environment
* System tools

Examples:

* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Fedora
* openSUSE

---

### Multi-user

Many users can use the same Linux system.

Example:

* University servers.
* Company servers.

---

### Multitasking

Linux can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

Example:

* Playing music.
* Browsing the Internet.
* Downloading files.

All of these can happen at the same time.

---

### Daemon

A daemon is a background service running in Linux.

Examples:

* Printing services
* Network services
* Web servers

> Windows calls them "Services." Linux calls them "Daemons."

---

### Filesystem

A filesystem organizes files and directories in Linux.

Linux uses:

```text
/
│
├── home
├── etc
├── var
├── boot
└── usr
```

`/` is called the root directory.

---

### Root Directory

The highest level of the Linux filesystem is called the root directory.

It is represented by:

```text
/
```

Everything starts from here.

---

### Package Manager

A tool used to:

* Install software.
* Update software.
* Remove software.

Examples:

* apt
* dnf
* zypper

---

### Repository

A repository is a trusted online storage location from which Linux downloads software packages.

---

### Boot Loader

A program that loads the operating system during startup.

Examples:

* GRUB

---

### Desktop Environment

Provides the graphical user interface (GUI).

Examples:

* GNOME
* KDE

It provides:

* Windows
* Icons
* Menus
* Settings

---

### GNOME

GNOME is the desktop environment used in this course.

---

### Command Line

A text-based interface used to communicate with Linux.

Example:

```bash
ls
pwd
mkdir Notes
```

---

### Man Pages

Linux's built-in documentation system.

Example:

```bash
man ls
```

This displays information about the `ls` command.

---

### Binary Compatible

It means software built for one distribution can usually run on another compatible distribution.

Example:

```text
RHEL
 ↓
AlmaLinux
 ↓
Rocky Linux
```

Many packages work across these distributions.

---

### Cloud Computing

Using computing resources such as:

* Servers
* Storage
* Networking

over the Internet.

Linux powers most cloud platforms today.
